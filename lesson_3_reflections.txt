When would you like to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

the remote repository helps us to collaborate with others and share our repository with other peoples.
It is really helpful when more than one person is working on a project. Many open source projects are 
there on github where anyone can see and contribute to that project.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

When more than one person is worknig on github it won't be wise to pull all the commits since there might be commits that won't be correct and 
would need some approval from the creators of the project to approve before pulling locally.
