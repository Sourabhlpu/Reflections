What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

when i fist initialize a repository a normal directory is converted into a repository as it contains some meta data about the history of the files
in the .git file

now I can keep track of the history of the files.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is the intermediate stage between a final commit and a directory. It offers the flexibility of adding selected files to a commit 
and thus enabling us to commit per logical change.


What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

Branches are useful when i am experimenting with my code and not sure if it would work. Its not adding a new feature or correcting the bugs and even editing 
the docs. As all of these can be done in the master branch.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

With the help of diagrams I can visualize the structure of my repository and I can identifiy the reachability of the nodes.
